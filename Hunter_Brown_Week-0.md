#### 1. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?

Working with a partner has helped me learn the most because if I have a better understanding on a subject I need to explain it to them and this helps me grasp the concept better. Also, when my partner has a better understanding then they explain it to me and I learn more comprehensively this way.
